# Hi ðŸ––, I am Benja.

Hi there! My name is Benja, and I am a full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience writing Node, TypeScript, React, React-Native, and Javascript. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve people's lives, and I am always looking for new and interesting challenges to tackle. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar, reading, or spending time with my friends and family. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope to connect with you soon!

## What I am all about

I am graduuating in a few months with a Bsc. in Software Engineering at Makerere University, Kampala. (FYI: I am killed it)

Also, I am focusing on coding, I love code, I breath code, I've not dreamed about it though.

### Interesting project

I've just redone my [personal site](https://v1b3m.vercel.app) and I kinda like it.
