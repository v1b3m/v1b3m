# Hi 🖖, I am vib'em.

I know, my name is so cool 💁‍♂️. Thanks.

## What I am all about

I am almost done studying Software Engineering at Makerere University, Kampala. (FYI: I am killing it)

Also, I am focusing on coding(This is just one in a million paths you can take as a Software Engineer)

### Interesting project

I've just redone my [data structures and algorithms project](https://bit.ly/33woAQZ) from my first year at University and you're  
welcome to collaborate, we could build something interesting together.
