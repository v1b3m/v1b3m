# Hi ðŸ––, I am Benja.

Hi there! My name is Benja, and I am a full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience writing Node, TypeScript, React, React-Native, Javascript, and a tonne of other stuff. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve people's lives, and I am always looking for new and interesting challenges to tackle. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing guitar, reading, or spending time with my friends and family. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope to connect with you soon!

## What I am all about

Not that it matters but I also have a Bsc. in Software Engineering.

Also, I am focusing on coding, I love code, I breath code, I've not dreamed about it though.
